                               CVMATIO
          An open source Matlab-MAT file parser written in C++
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CVMATIO implements a Matlab v7 MAT file parser in C++, giving users the 
ability to interact with binary MAT files in their own projects. 

The project has the following dependencies:
    
    OpenCV  REQUIRED (for translating Matlab types)
    CMake   REQUIRED (for building)
    ZLib    REQUIRED (for uncompressing Mat files)
    Doxygen OPTIONAL (for documentation)

BUILDING
To configure the project, set the options at the top of CMakeLists.txt
To build the project, follow the normal cmake routine from the root folder:

    >> mkdir build
    >> cd build/
    >> cmake ..
    >> make -j8

Modified by Samarth Brahmbhatt to make the build process simpler. Build instructions above will now put the dynamic library in a 'lib' folder and executable in a 'bin' folder.
